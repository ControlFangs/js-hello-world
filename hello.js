/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/


console.log("A fresh start") 
console.log ("1+1=2")
//or to add two numbers together I belive you can do this\\
const num1 = 1;
const num2 = 1;
const sum = num1 + num2; 
console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${sum}.`);



/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed. Done
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do: its a fuction you put something in the parenthisies and that thing will come out  . Will the code work without them? It won't
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
